c+h freely, I'm always afk. Whispers is preferred if you want to talk, my public chat can be off sometimes.
i mostly chat through my party members

i maybe awake till 5am GMT+8 i may sleep early depending if i have to wake up early for school or some important things to do

i can be seen with my vocaloids (mostly rin or other types of rin) or evillious chronicles cosplays/skins! because this alt account focuses on that!
im usually with my friend [Jex](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=77023312) too!
