AGE BOUNDARIES / LIMIT! below 14 plz dni if u want or JUST DON'T BE WEIRD AROUND ME NOR WITH MY FRIENDS THANKS, ill stop talking to you immediately if you start talking about weird stuff that i may or my friends may not or might not like at all. we can talk normally and be friends/oomfs but that's it!! no closure plzz thx.

c+h freely, I'm always offtab or afk. Whispering is highly preferred when you want to yap to me i don't mind. sorry in advance if i didn't see your whisper. i might turn off public chats when i get wayyyy too overwhelmed or is not in the mood to talk at all.

im usually seen above market or near bsd area on the pine tree with rock, i honestly don't know why i like to stay on that particular spot. i can also be seen around with my close friends or wherever they are

i am anti-social but i am nice and will try my best to talk to you, i am not sensitive or whatsoever I generally don't care about stuff you do if its nothing weird likeee... REALLLLYYY WEIRRDDD.. quick warning is that once i open up to you, you might see the real me.

Kys jokes or other Jokes do not really have bad effects on me, unless ITS REALLY something offensive or a slur that you can't reclaim. that's a big no no buddy

this GitHub can be seen with my vocaloids (mostly rin or other types of rin) or evillious chronicles cosplays/skins! because this alt account focuses on that!
im usually with my friend Jex or Kara, or my party members which are mostly my close friends ^_^!
@[oceanasterism](https://github.com/oceanasterism) is my main and that is not focused on one fandom
