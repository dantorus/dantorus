c+h freely, I'm always afk. Whispers is preferred if you want to talk, my public chat can be off sometimes.

i maybe awake till 5am GMT+8 it may sleep early depending if i have to wake up early for school or some important things to do

i can be seen with my vocaloids or evillious chronicles cosplays/skins! because this alt account focuses on that!
@shiningumbreon is my main for everything that is not focused on one fandom
