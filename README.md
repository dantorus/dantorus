AGE BOUNDARIES / LIMIT! below 14 plz dni or DON'T BE WEIRD  ill cry if you do. I GUESS. we can talk normally and be friends/oomfs but that's it!! no closure plzz thx.

update: killing myself when i saw some grammar mistakes ohmygod. im so very sorry for that but its fixed though 

anyone is allowed to interact anytime or not unless you fit in the basic dni criteria OR i put dniuf or dniuc! if your gonna ask what it means, it means do not interact not unless your a friend or close friend!
if i put either s-nv or nv expect me not to chat!

Q - what does nv and s-nv means?
it means nonverbal and semi-nonverbal, i use these two when im really exhausted or i don't feel like talking a lot and spacing out a LOTTT..

c+h freely, I'm always semi-afk. Whispers is preferred if you want to talk, my public chat can be off sometimes.
i mostly chat through my party members

im usually seen above market or near bsd area on the pine tree with rock, i honestly don't know why i like to stay on that particular spot not unless my friends drags me or i drag them elsewhere or my friends get overwhelmed by the amount of ponies and make their screen lag.
or wherever my close friends at or party members!

i maybe awake till 5am GMT+8 i may sleep early depending if i have to wake up early for school or some important things to do

this GitHub can be seen with my vocaloids (mostly rin or other types of rin) or evillious chronicles cosplays/skins! because this alt account focuses on that!
im usually with my friend Jex or Kara, or my party members which are mostly my close friends ^_^!
@[shiningumbreon](https://github.com/shiningumbreon) is my main and that is not focused on one fandom
